trend_interpretation: |
  Improved from 26/35 to 30/35 (+4 points).
  Key improvements:
  - Test coverage achieved 100% (from unmeasured)
  - All core functions verified and working
  - Gap-4 (test coverage) successfully closed
  
  Remaining challenges:

# === Critical Success Factors ===
critical_success_factors:
  achieved:
    - "100% test coverage (exceeds 80% target)"
    - "All core extraction functions working"

    - "Thorough evidence gathering (all source files examined)"
    - "Rigorous verification (all core functions tested)"
    - "Clear communication (summary.md, next_questions.md comprehensive)"

  what_could_improve:
    - "Could provide more detailed implementation steps for critical PRs"
    - "Could add technical feasibility assessment for each PR"
    - "Could estimate effort for each PR"

  next_audit_goals:
    - "Close Gap-1 (Slack integration) - highest priority"
    - "Close Gap-2 (Metrics tracking) - enables primary mission"
    - "Close Gap-3 (Topic ledger) - unblocks workflow"
    - "Achieve purpose_alignment score of 5/5"

# === Conclusion ===
conclusion: |
  This audit successfully validated the repository's core extraction engine (100% coverage, 
  all functions verified) but identified critical gaps blocking the primary mission of 
  KPL visualization.
  
  The repository is in excellent technical shape but incomplete functionally.
  
  Next cycle must focus on Phase 2 implementation to achieve the repository's full potential.
  
  Overall Grade: B+ (30/35)
  
  Recommendation: Proceed with Phase 2 - Slack Integration & Metrics
